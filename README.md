## Hangman Game
### Introduction
This will be a basic iteration of the game hangman. This is a student project made by a group of five students for our software engineering class. The game will randomly choose a word from a bank and gives the player a certain number of guesses to find letters within the word. Since this is still a work in progress there will be more features soon.
